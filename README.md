After I completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate on Coursera, I found a Google easter egg link to a code challenge site. This repo records my answers to the challenges, as a relatively beginner programmer.

Look at it if you are, say, a HR person looking for evidence that I can code at all.
DON'T look if you don't want spoilers for said challenge site.
