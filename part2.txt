We are greeted by a console. I can retrieve challenges with request and use the following other commands:
cd	change directory [dir_name]
cat	print file [file_name]
deleteme	delete all of your data associated with foobar
edit	open file in editor [file_name]
feedback	provide feedback on foobar
less	print a file a page at a time [file_name]
ls	list directory contents [dir_name]
request	request new challenge
status	print progress
submit	submit final solution file for assessment [file_name]
